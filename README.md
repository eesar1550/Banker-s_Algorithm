# Deadlock Detection and Avoidance System using Banker‚Äôs Algorithm

This project implements a Deadlock Detection and Avoidance System using the Banker's Algorithm. It simulates resource allocation in a multi-process system and ensures system safety by avoiding deadlocks.

## üîç Overview

The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for a predetermined maximum possible amount of all resources, then makes an "s-state" check to test for possible activities before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

## üí° Features

- Safe state detection
- Deadlock detection
- User-defined number of processes and resources
- Dynamic input of maximum, allocation, and available resources
- Visual representation of resource allocation and safe sequence (if applicable)


## üß™ How It Works

1. User enters:
   - Number of processes and resources
   - Allocation matrix
   - Maximum matrix
   - Available resources
2. The algorithm checks whether the system is in a safe state.
3. If safe, the safe sequence is returned.
4. If not, a potential deadlock is reported.
